# CRUD-Website

My name is Jose Luis Santiago Montiel
I'm a sophmore going into junior year learning about computer science. 
I decided to take my first computer science class this year and this was one of our projects. 
After taking this course, I have a new love for computer science and programming and have now considered it for a furture career.
This year was a lot of fun, and this is my webiste. 

My website revolves around CRUD, which means it creates data, reads data, updates data, and deletes data. 
The languages I used include HTML, PHP, SQL, and CSS (no JS sadly). 
To use my website, download the coressponding files and open them up in Cloud9. 
Then run the project and it should bring up the UI.

I made this website for a few reasons.
One, for the grade, two, because I wanted to keep a log of all the games I finished, and three, because I wanted to make something, anything. 
I wanted to have some sort of log I could have to fill in all of the games that I've finished so I can say I either finished it or should I play it again. 
This project allowed me to test my skills in these languages and it was sure hard. I'm not the best programmer, but I feel I got by. 

Hopefully you find this as interesting as I did.
